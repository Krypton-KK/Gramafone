# Gramafone
my school project which focused on using csv, txt, yaml, sql and python to create a end to end encrypted chat client using sockets.

My school project (Gramafone) uses csv files to store data and keys on a physical drive and store the codes of these on a (home) sql server over the internet using sockets.
it took me about 4 months to start and end this project. with 1000s of lines of code i was able to implement:
- store and retrive data
- use encryption using cryptography module.
- add excess manual encyption by shifting ascii values of the keys themselves and decrypting the keys.
- transfer files in an encrypted manner by using read() and write() functions
- use sockets to transport the data
- and also tried to open and close ports using python code and making the code work even when it is used with others on the internet in other local networks
  
I would like to improve this code and later publish it as an app.
